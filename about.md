Hey! My Name is Bryce and I am a Comp Sci major at LCCC, I plan on attending East Stroudsburg University next fall to finish up my Comp Sci degree as well as dual major in Comp Sec and possibly get a minor in Business Management. I will be posting misc. code and projects I do here as well as just random posts about things I find interesting or do.

Thanks for reading!
