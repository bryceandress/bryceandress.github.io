title: Introducing pyPodcastr For Your Podcast Catching Needs
---

I wrote pyPodcastr because I was in need of a simple podcast catcher I could
run with cron. pyPodcastr downloads the latest podcast from each RSS feed you give
it. The only dependency this project requires is feedparser which can be installed
with pip3. If anyone would like any features or bugs worked out open up an issue. 
Without further ado here is the Github 
[repo](https://www.github.com/bryceandress/pyPodcastr)
