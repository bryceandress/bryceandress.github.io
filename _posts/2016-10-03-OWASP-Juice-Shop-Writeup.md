title: OWASP Juice Shop Walkthrough
---

Hello all, it has been quite a while since I posted a writeup on anything so today I am going to start a post about the OWASP Juice Shop.
This is a newer VM put out by OWASP that includes vulnerabilities from their top 10 list. I am going to start with the first one on the 
scoreboard which is insanely easy! 

Scoreboard:
Juice Shop comes with a scoreboard but it is not easily accessible from somewhere on the website. In order to get this challenge you need 
read through the source on the homepage and about 2/3 of the way down you will find a commented out link which brings you to the scoreboard
gaining you your first points.

TO BE CONTINUED.
