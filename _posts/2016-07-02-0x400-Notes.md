# TCP Flags Stored in Header
* URG
    - Urgent
    - Identifies important data
* ACK
    - Acknowledgement
    - Acknowledges a packet; it is turned on for the majority of the connection
* PSH
    - Push
    - Tells receiver to push the data through instead of buffering it
* RST
    - Reset
    - Resets a connection
* SYN
    - Synchronize
    - Synchronizes sequence numbers at the beginning of a connection
* FIN
    - Finish
    - Gracefully closes a connection when both sides say goodbye

# TCP Connection

* Sequence number and acknowledgment number are used to maintain state
* SYN and ACK flags are used to open connections in a 3 step handshake
    - Client sends packet with SYN flag on and ACK flag off
    - Then Server responds with a packet with both flags on
    - Finally Client sends back a packet with SYN flag off but ACK on
    - After this every packet will hace the ACK flag on and SYN off
* Sequence numbers all TCP to put unordered packets back into order
    - Helps determine whether packets are missing
    - Also helps aboiding mix ups
* TCP is great for applications where reliability and bidirectional communication are needed

# UDP is a faster but less reliable than TCP
* UDP like the IP protocol is connectionless and unreliable
    - Expects application to deal with its connectionless
# Unswitched Netowrk
* Packets pass through every device on the network
* Each device is expected to only look at packets addressed to them
* It is very easy to go into **Promiscuous Mode** which causes it to look at all packets
* **Sniffing** is the act of capturing packets that aren't necessarily meant for public view

# Switched Network
* Only sent to the port they are assigned
* Requires more intelligent hardware
* One techniqure is to spoof **Source Address**
* When an ARP reply comes in with an IP that exists, the receiver will overwrite MAC
* ARP keeps no state information
* With theses details an **ARP Redirection** can be execute
* The act of changing entries in the ARP Cache is called **ARP Cache Poisoning**

# TCP/IP Hijacking is a clever technique that uses spoofed packets to take over a connection
* Attacker must be on the same network
* Very usefule for one-time passworks

## RST Hijacking
* Form of TCP/IP hijacking
    - Involves  injecting an authentic looking reset packet
    - If  Source is spoofed an ACK number is correct receiving side will believe it should restart transmission
