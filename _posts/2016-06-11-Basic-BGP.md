title: Basic BGP

# BGP
* Border Gateway Protocolv4
* Dynamic routing protocol
* De facto Internet routing protocol

## How it works
* Neighbors peer in that one neighbor, or peer, opens a TCP connection to the other
* Routing information is transferred across that connection

## Common confusion
* BGP transfers routing information
* BGP does not in itself "route"
* A routes takes in BGP information forms a BGP
* A router also knows its connected and static routes
* A router compares all these tables and forms a Routing Information Base (RIB) and possibly a Forwarding Information Base (FIB)
* The RIB or FIB (if it exists) is what a router uses to route packets

## How is BGP used in the PTD network
* Load-sharing to and from our providers by implementaiton of policies
    - Any change to the default behavior of BGP is accomplished with routing policies
    - Policies applied to OUTBOUND advertisements to peers affect INBOUND traffic from our peers
    - Policies applied to inbound advertisements from our peers affect OUTBOUND traffic to our peers
* Spoken internally to distribute traffic laod
* Spoken with multihomed customers

## Basic Config
See Introduction to BGP slides 8-13

## Basic Troubleshooting
* Needed in two scenarios
    - A BGP session is down
    - Routing to the internet is broken
* Commands
    - show bgp summary - gives list of neighbors, their ASNs, states of the sessions, and number of prefixes received
    - State of active means the session is actually down
    - show bgp neighbor <neighbor_ip> gives details on a particular session
* Looking for misconfigs
    - Is the peer IP address correct?
    - Is the peer ASN correct?
    - Is the peer IP reachable? Can you ping it?
    - If EGBP, is the IP more than one hop away?
* If routing to the internet is broken
    - see if there is a route from our netowrk to the destination
        + show ip bgp <destination_ip_address>
        + show ip route <ip_address>
    - see if there is a route from somewhere on the Internet back to the source that
        + there are many route-servers availabe
        + show ip bgp <source_ip_address>
* Traceroutes from our network and from a route-server will help pinpoint a problem
* Work with the problem AS for possible routing problems or route filter problems
