# Lesson 1 The Purpose of Networks

* Networks are about making connections

* Used to File Share, Print, Web Surfing, and Database Access

# Lesson 2 Common Network Components

* Routers
    - Layer 3 device
		- Makes forwarding decisions on logical information
		- Gives up ability to scale and extra flexibility

* Switches
		- Layer 2 device
		- Makes forwarding decisions based on what it learns

* Clients
		- End users

* Server
		- What end users are trying to access
		- Makes files/applications available to clients

* Classifications
    - LAN
		- WAN

## Legacy Network Components

* Hubs
    - Interconnects clients, servers, and other devices
		- Does not make forwarding decisions
		- Also known as a bit spitter
		- One collision domain

* MAU - Media Access Unit
    - Interconnects clients, servers, and other network devices
		- Does not make forwarding decisions
		- Used in Token Ring networks
		- Collision domains don't apply here
	      +  When you receive the token it is your turn to transmit data
	  - One broadcast domain

* Bridge
    - Seperates networks into collision domains
		- Makes forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses
		- Predecessor to the Ethernet switch
		- One broadcast domain
		- As main dollision domains as there are ports

## Network Media

* Coaxial Cable
    - Used in 10BASE2 and 10BASE5 Ethernet networks
		- 50 Ohms of impedance

* Twisted Pair
    - The twists in the wire protects the inner conductors from EMI
		- Shielded and Unshieled Options
		- Most common media type found in modern LANs
		- TIA/EIA-568 Standard - 1991
		     + TIA/EIA is a Standards Body
				 + Updated in 2001
		- CAT3 PBXs and 10BASE-T
		- CAT5  100BASE-TX
		- CAT5e 1000BASE-T
		- CAT6  1000BASE-T
		- CAT6a 10GBASE-T
		- Crossover Cable
		    + Pins 1 & 2 connect to pins 3 & 6
			  + Pins 3 & 4 connect to pins 1 & 4
			  + Pins 5 & 6 connect to pins 5 & 2
			  + Pins 7 & 8 connect to pins 7 & 8
	  - This makes receive pair on one side go to transmit on the other side
		- MDIX can reverse a port's transmit and receive pairs
		    + Can be found on most newer Cisco switches

* Fiber Optics
    - Uses pulses of light to represent binary data
		- Not subject to EMI
		- Commonly used in high speed networks where the distance requirement is too great for UTP
		- Two Types:
		    + MMF - Multimode Fiber
				+ SMF -Single Mode Fiber
		- Multimode Delay Distortion
		    + Bits get out of order, because they are represented by different paths of light
		- Dopants
		    + Impurities put in the core and cladding to give the glasses different indicies of refraction
		- Angle of Incidence
		    + The angle at which light intersects the core
	  - Single Mode
		    + The core has a diameter so small that light can only enter at one angle

# Lesson 3 Categorizing Networks

## LAN

* Within a single building
* Client connects to a switch
* Servers also connect to switches
* Routers break up and interconnect IP ranges
    - Switches connect to router
* LANs are typically high speed

## WAN

* Interconnects geographic locations that are dispersed
* Speeds are slower than LAN by quite a bit
* Within WANs we can have 1 or multiple LANs

## MAN

* Interconnects office spaces in a city
* Connects at speeds much faster than WANs but still a tad slower than LANs
* Different wave lengths of light, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) is used to seperate clients data
* Lambda represents a wavelength
* It is also redundant

## PAN

* Personal Area Networks interconnects personal devices
* Bluetooth is most popular
* Infra Red
* Interconnects 2 devices
* Over limited distance with limited throughput

## CAN

* Campus Area Network
* Interconnects different buildings on a campus
* Buildings usual point to one central hub (building)
* Normally have buildings pointing to one another form a mesh topology
* Usually uses fiber optic (multimode)

## Ring Topology

* Interconnects devices in a circular fashion
* Supported speeds of 4 Mbps or 16 Mbps
* Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)
* Logical Topology describers flow of a network
* Each computer gets a chance to add something to the token if it is empty
* Physical Tolpolgy describes how Network Devices are physically connected
* MAU Media access unit used in Token Ring Networks to Physically Interconnect Networked Devices
* Star Topology - Every devices points to the MAU but there is still a ring in the MAU
* Not used in modern day networks

## Bus Topology

* Commonly used in early Ethernet Networks
* 50 Ohms coaxial cable
* Thinnet (10BASE2)
    - Distance Limitation 185 Meters
		- Throughtput: 10 Mbps

* Thicknet (10Base5)
     - Distance Limitation of 500 Meters
		 - Throughput: 10Mbps

* One main line that each computer taps into
* One challenge is that devices do not take turns causing a lot of collisions
* Each device then waits a random amount of time to retransmit data
* CSMA/CD - Carrier Sense Multiple Acces with Collision Detection

## Star Topology

* Devices connect back to a centralized device
* Makes forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses
* If one link fails, other links continue to function
* Popular in modern networks

## Hub and Spoke Topology

* Used in WAN
* Make one site HQ and have WAN links going to every other site
* Remote sites connect back to a central site
* Saves money
* Can result in subpoptimal pathing

## Full Mesh Topology

* Every site is connected to all the other sites
* Opposite of Hub and Spoke Topology
* Optimal Pathing
* Very expensive
* (n(n-1))/2 = Links you need for Full Mesh Topology

## Partial Mesh Topology

* Not every site is connected but some are.
* Hub and Spoke with a couple extra connections between sites

## Client Server Architecture

* Clients share resources made available by a server
* NOS Network Operating System
    - Specializes in serving up files
* Also known as Client Server Network

## Peer to Peer Achitecture

* Clients share their rerouses with one another
* In clients you can make things (printer and files) a shared resource
* Different from Client Server since no machine is handling all the serving
* Not as robust as using a NOS

** End of Module One **

# Protocol Reference Models Introduction

## OSI Model

* A 7 layer reference model

* Open System Interconnect Model

* ISO OSI Model

* Bottom of OSI Model is layer 1
    - Physical Layer
		- Responsible for bits on the network

* Layer 2
    - Switches, makes forwarding decisions based on physical properties (MAU)

* Layer 3
    - Logical addressing (IP addressing)

* Layer 4
    - Primary protocols
		- TCP and UDP

* Layer 5, 6, 7
    - Session, Presentation, and Application
		- Does not need to populate all 7 layers

* Presentation layer is responsible for how data is presented
    - Might encode text with ASCII
		- Encryption is also at this layer

* Application Layer
    - Services
		- Microsoft Active Directory

* All People Seem To Need Data Processing
    - Starts at top

* Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away
    - Starts at bottom

* Best metaphor
    - Think of the OSI Model as a bookshelf

## Layer 1

* PDUs Protocol Data Units

* Physical -> Bits

* Data Link -> Frames, Packets

* Network -> Packets, Datagrams

* Transport -> Packets, Segments

* Some People Fear Birthdays (Memory aid)

* Physical Layer
    - How bits are represents on the medium
    - Current State Modulation
		    + Binary valeus are determined by the presense or absence of electricity
	  - Alternate Mark Inversion (AVI) alternates volatage polarities in an attempt to have an avg of 0 volts on the wire
		-   State Transition Modulation binary values are based on a change in voltage
		- Wiring standards for connectors and jacks
		- TIA/EIA-568-B Standard
		    + Descibes wiring of an RJ-45 connector
		- Physcial Topologies - Star, Bus, Ring
		- Syncronizing bits
		    + Asynchronous - Sender sends Start and Stop bits
				+ Synchronous - Both sender and receiver use internal clocks
		- Bandwidth Usage
		    + Broadband - different communication flows use different frequency
		    + Baseband - all frequencies on a channel are used for one conversation
		- Multiplexing Strategy
		    + Time Division Multiplexxing
				    - Channel 1 gets a set amount of time and the Channel 2 and so on
				+ Statistical TDM
				    - Time slots are dynamically assigned based on need
				+ Frequency Division Multiplexxing (FDM)
				    - Range of frequencies used for download and some for upload

## Data Link Layer

* Has two sub layers
    - Mac and LLC

* MAC

    - Physcial addressing
		- 48-bit addressed burned into the network burned into NIC cards
		- Each device is completely unique
		- Hex digits
	  - Logical Topology
		    + How traffic flows
				+ MAUs physically connect has a star but logically it works as a ring
		- Method of transmitting
		    + token in token ring
			  + CSMA/CD Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
* LLC

    - Flow Control - If sender is sending to quickly the receiver can tell sender to slow down
		- Error Control - Data expected to receive was not received
		- Synchronization of transmission
		- Isochronous
		     + Look to common device for clocking, creates fixed timeslots
				 + Low overhead
		- Asynchronous
		     + Devices reference internal clock. Sender sends stop and start bit
				 + Parity bits used for errors
				     - Even and odd parity
		- Synchronous
		     + Share clocking over separte com channels
				 + Uses CRC for error checking
				     - Cyclic Redundancy Check
    - Switch is most common layer 2 device
		- As switch sees traffic it builds a MAC table or Content Addressable Memory Table

   **Example MAC/CAM Table**
		Port | MAC
		----------
		1    |AAAA
		2    |BBBB
		3    |CCCC

		- What if one of the ports is another switch?
		    + New switch learns about devices connected to it
				+ Table will look like

		Port | MAC
		-----------
		1    | AAAA
		2    | DDDD
		2    | EEEE
		3    | CCCC

## The Network Layer

* Logical Addressing
    - IPv4 IPv6 IPX AppleTalk

* Switching
		- how to send packets to other devices
	  - Packet Switching
		    + Data is divided into packets
				+ Has heaser with source and destination address
    - Router makes packet forwarding decsions based on logical addressing
		- Circuit Switching
		    + Temp connection
				+ Brought up as needed
				+ Think of Phone Line
		- Message Switching
		    + Data stream is broken into messages
				+ Similair to email
				+ Not delivered immediately
		- Route discovery and selection
		- Directly connected, statically configured, Dynamically learned
		- Example of Protocols
		    + RIP
				+ IS-IS
				+ BGP
		- Flow Control
		- Packet Reordering

* Router is most common layer 3 device

## The Transport Layer

* Protocols

* Windowing

* Buffering

* TCP/IP
    - Transmission Controlled Protocol
		- User Datagram Protocol
		- TCP is connectionful
		- UDP is connectionless
		    + Faster than TCP lower overhead
	  - RTP
		    + Is encapuslated in a UDP in voice communication

* Windowing
    - Sliding Window - Allows TCP window size to grow based on network reliability
		- 2 Billion bytes per window on a solid connection

* Buffering
    - Queue
		    + Router stores up packets until bandwidth becomes available

## The Upper Layers

* No longer have PDUs at this level
* Protocol was not developed for just IP
* Every layer does not need to be used, OSI is a reference

*  Session
    - Setting up a session
    - Maintaining a session
		- Tearing down a session

* Presentation
    - Data formatting
        + ASCII
		    + EBCDIC
    - Encryption

* Application
    - Application services
		    + Email service lives at this level
				+ File sharing service
		- Service advertisement
				+ Shared printer

## TCP/IP Model

* Network Interface in OSI it is Physical and Data
    - Also know as Network Access Layer

* Internet Layer
    - Maps to network layer of OSI Model

* Transport Layer
    - Maps to same name in OSI model
		    + TCP and UDP again
		- **TCP Slow Start** TCP reduces its window size if a segment gets dropped

* Application Layer
    - Maps to Applicatino, presentation, and session layers
