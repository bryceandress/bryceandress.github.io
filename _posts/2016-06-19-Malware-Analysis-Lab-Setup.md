title: Malware Anaylsis Lab Setup and Resources
---

Late last week I decided I would like to take a step into Malware Analysis. So far I have
not invested as much time into this as I would like but I have managed to setup a fairly
complete Windows 7 Virtual Machine that includes a ton of the tools an analysist would
usually need. Some of the tools I have installed are:
* 010 which is one of my favorite Windows Hex Editors
* Cygwin which is pretty much a complete Linux Terminal for on Windows
* IDA Starter which is probably the best decompiler currently in existence
* Dependency Walker which allows you to see what resources a peice of malware is using
* Fakenet is a tool simulates a network so that malware interacting with a remote host
  continues to run allowing the analyst to observe the malwareâ€™s network activity from
	within a safe environment.
* OllyDBG is also installed on this system as an alternatvie to IDA
* PEview might be the most important tool and it is used in anaylzing PE files.
* Resource Hacker which has many different uses but is mainly used in editting files

I also took a snapshot once everything was configured so I always have somewhere to fall
back too. As well gathering these utilities I also have come across a couple great
resources which I am going to list now and link if possible:

* Practical Malware Analysis and its lab materails
    - Pretty much the Bible as far as getting started with this stuff goes
* Cybrary's Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering Class
* [RPISEC's Malware Anaylsis Course](https://github.com/RPISEC/Malware)
* [Awesome Malware Anaylsis](https://github.com/rshipp/awesome-malware-analysis)
* [The Zoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo)
    - The Zoo is a Github repo of malware samples and source code

In the next week or two I plan on uploading a couple posts on a step by step anaylsis of
different malware samples. If anyone is interested in a copy of my .vdi let me know and
if you have any questions also let me know!
