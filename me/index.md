Hello, my name is Bryce. I am studying Computer Science at a local community college and in the fall I plan to attend Kutztown to continue studying Computer Science. This website is to showcase some of my projects, studies, and write-ups I do for CTF events. Speaking of which I am a member of teamOops, we compete in CTF events.

# What do you do?
Study, Code, CTF, Mod Keyboards, and most importantly Eat...a lot.

# What are your short term goals?
Graduate school in the next 3 years, hopefully with a Masters in Computer Science and a focus in Security.

# Okay, how about long term?
I eventually plan on opening up my own security consulting firm
